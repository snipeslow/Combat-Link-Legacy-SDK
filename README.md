**Currently requires using UDONSharp. CyanTriggers and Graph support requires using the wrapper version in place of the UDONSharp version of the prefab!**

# What is Combat Link?
Combat Link is a system/standard in which allows a world to give your avatar's HUD data, such as your health, status effects, and other information. All in a prefab you can stick on your avatar!

# Who made made it? Why?
I (Snipeslow) started this project a long time ago when I noticed a shader based workaround (popularized by AudioLink's method) to get data to avatars. Made easier with an official VRC update that introduced the method in a more proper manner. However, it took a long time to figure out how to make a screen space HUD, due to not understanding matrices until recently (even then, it's still an eldritch thing to me). I made the system to be used by the Avatar PVP community, free. And other communities too.

# Can you make *X* hud from *X* game?
I do not take requests. BUT I am willing to teach, either through video tutorials or direct teaching if I spot ya in a voice channel. Planned HUDs I will have outright are:
- Star Wars Clone Commando
- Halo Reach MJOLNIR Mark V
- My Example HUD
- Half Life 2 HEV

# Can you make a Dead Space style health bar?
No, due to how Combat Link sends data. There might be a way to do it later, but I will have to research it.

# Features
- Health Bar
- Auxiliary Health Bar (Or Shield in some contexts, like Halo. Or Armor, like in Half Life 2)
- Minimap Support
- Oxygen Bar
- Temperature Bar
- Status Effect Icons

# Credits
- Snipeslow, the main coder
- error.mdl, their original hud served as an inspiration

# Disclaimer
Combat Link is not affiliated with AudioLink team. The name just sounds cool and tactical. Combat Link works only in worlds that implement the system and will not work in worlds that haven't implemented the system.
